    "## Inputs and outputs of a RNN\n",
    "We start with the two input vectors of the RNN, the input vector and the hidden state.\n",
    "### Input $x$\n",
    "The number of units is represented as $n_x$. It can be understood as the number of units in a single timestep of a single training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A timestep in a single input example is represented as $x^{(i) \\langle t \\rangle }$. The timesteps are indexed as $t$. Normally, a single training example $x^{(i)}$ will consist of multiple time steps $T_x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training examples are grouped into so-called mini batches $x$ of size $m$. Thus, the shape of a mini batch is $(n_x,m,T_x)$. $x$ is thus a 3-dimension tensor and this will be our input into the RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will be working with mini-batches of training examples, we will need a 2D slide $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ of the same shape of our mini batch, $(n_x, m)$. In our implementation, this will be the variable `xt`.\n",
    "### Hidden State $a$\n",
    "The second input required in a RNN is the hidden state $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, an activation function. The hidden state is passed from one step to the next. It shares similarities with our input vector $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it has a length $n_{a}$, and if we include a mini-batch of size $m$, the shape of the mini-batch will be $(n_{a},m)$. The hidden state also makes use of the same index $t$ to iterate and on each loop it uses a 2D slice $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ of shape $(n_{a}, m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, we will have two variables for the hidden state. They will be called `a_prev` and `a_next`.\n",
    "Similarly, on each step, we produce an output vector.\n",
    "### Output $\\hat{y}$\n",
    "The ouput $\\hat{y}$ is also a 3D tensor. Its shape is $(n_{y}, m, T_{y})$, where $n_{y}$ represents the number of units in the vector representing the prediction. As it is the case with the input, $m$ reflects the number of examples in the mini batch and $T_{y}$ the number of steps in the prediction. In our implementation, we will be defining this variable as `y_pred`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we go more in depth and look at a single time step $t$, we have a 2D slice $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ with shape $(n_{y}, m)$. Similarly, the variable in our code for this 2D slice will be called `yt_pred`.\n",
    "## The RNN cell\n",
    "In the animation above, we see that the RNN model consists basically of looping over a single cell over the index $t$. As we outlined above, we take the input consisting of two vectors, the current input $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, and the previous hidden state $a^{\\langle t - 1\\rangle}$. \n",
    "At the same time, we will be passing to the next RNN cell two outputs. They are the hidden state  $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ and the prediction $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$.\n",
    "Let's start by implementing the RNN cell!\n",
    "## Task 1. Simple Cell (4 points)\n",

    "* **(1 pt.)** First, start by implementing the hidden state $a$ with the tanh activation function. It is defined as \n",
    "$$\n",

    "* **(1 pt.)** Fourth return `accumulator` and $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ , $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's not forget that on each step, the RNN cell takes two inputs, the current input data $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ and the hidden state from the previous cell, $a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$.
